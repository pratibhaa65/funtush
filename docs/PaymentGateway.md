# Payment Integration
 
## Overview
 
Implemented a secure and scalable payment integration system that enables agencies to securely manage payment gateway credentials and subscribe to paid plans through **Stripe** and **Nepali payment gateways (Khalti, eSewa, ConnectIPS, and Fonepay)**. The solution combines encrypted credential storage, subscription lifecycle management, Stripe webhook processing, local payment gateway integration, QR-based payment collection, unified payment verification, automated grace period handling, and comprehensive automated testing to ensure secure payment operations, reliable billing, and resilient payment workflows.
 
> **Note:** Stripe integration serves as a template for international expansion and is not currently available in Nepal. Nepali payment gateways (Khalti, eSewa, ConnectIPS, and Fonepay) are the primary payment methods for agencies in Nepal.
 
## Features
 
### Secure Credential Storage
 
Implemented encrypted storage for payment gateway credentials using **AES-256-GCM** encryption to ensure sensitive information is protected at rest.
 
#### Security Implementation
 
- AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm
- Random 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV) generated for each encryption
- Encrypted format: `iv:authTag:encrypted` (hex encoded)
- Encryption key loaded from environment variables
- Credentials stored as write-only and never exposed through API responses
### Subscription Management
 
Integrated Stripe subscription billing to manage agency subscription plans and automate the billing lifecycle.
 
#### Subscription Flow
 
1. Agency subscribes to a selected subscription tier.
2. Stripe customer is created using the agency email.
3. Stripe subscription is generated with tier-based pricing.
4. Client Secret is returned for frontend payment confirmation.
### Nepali Payment Gateway Integration
 
Integrated **Khalti**, **eSewa**, and **ConnectIPS** to support subscription payments through local payment providers.
 
#### Supported Providers
 
- Khalti
- eSewa
- ConnectIPS
#### Payment Flow
 
1. Agency selects a subscription tier.
2. Agency chooses a preferred payment provider.
3. Payment request is initiated with the selected provider.
4. Provider-specific payment verification is performed.
5. Subscription is activated automatically after successful verification.
### Fonepay QR Payments
 
Integrated **Fonepay** as a QR-based local payment method, complementing the subscription-focused Khalti, eSewa, and ConnectIPS gateways by enabling agencies to collect trekker booking payments directly.
 
#### KYC-Gated Activation
 
Agencies can only activate Fonepay once their KYC submission has been approved, ensuring payment collection is only enabled for verified agencies.
 
##### Activation Flow
 
1. Agency requests Fonepay activation.
2. System checks the agency's KYC submission status.
3. If approved, a static QR code is generated via the Fonepay API.
4. The QR record is created (or updated if one already exists) and marked active.
5. The agency's tier-based transaction fee percentage is returned alongside the QR code.
#### Static & Dynamic QR Codes
 
Supports two QR modes to cover different payment scenarios.
 
- **Static QR** — generated once at activation, reusable for any payment amount.
- **Dynamic QR** — generated per booking with a fixed amount, only available once Fonepay has been activated for the agency.
#### Tier-Based Transaction Fees
 
Each subscription tier has an associated transaction fee percentage, stored independently and looked up whenever a Fonepay payment is processed.
 
##### Fee Calculation
 
- `feeAmount = amount * (feePercentage / 100)`
- `netAmount = amount - feeAmount`
Fees are calculated for every verified transaction, stored alongside the gross amount, fee amount, and net amount, providing a complete audit trail for payment reporting and settlement.
 
#### Trekker-Facing Payment Verification
 
Implemented a public (unauthenticated) verification endpoint so trekkers can confirm payment after scanning a Fonepay QR code.
 
##### Verification Process
 
1. Trekker submits the transaction ID and amount after paying.
2. System confirms Fonepay is active for the target agency.
3. Tier fee is looked up and the fee/net split is calculated.
4. Transaction is verified directly against the Fonepay API (status + amount match).
5. On success, a transaction record is created with status `success` and a `verifiedAt` timestamp.
6. On failure, the request is rejected and no transaction record is created.
#### Status Lookup
 
Agencies can check their current Fonepay configuration at any time, including activation state, QR type, QR image URL, and applicable fee percentage.
 
### Unified Payment Verification
 
Implemented a single verification endpoint that supports all Nepali subscription payment providers.
 
#### Verification Process
 
- Detects the payment provider automatically.
- Verifies payment with the respective provider.
- Records provider-specific verification details for auditing.
- Maintains separate transaction records for Khalti, eSewa, and ConnectIPS.
- Updates the agency subscription after successful verification.
### Webhook Processing
 
Implemented secure Stripe webhook handling with signature verification to synchronize payment events between Stripe and the application.
 
#### Supported Events
 
##### `invoice.paid`
 
- Updates subscription status to **Active**
- Extends the subscription period to the next billing cycle
- Clears any existing grace period
- Records successful payment logs
- Sends payment confirmation notifications
- Continues processing even if notification delivery fails
##### `invoice.payment_failed`
 
- Changes subscription status to **Grace Period**
- Starts a 7-day grace period
- Records failed payment logs
- Sends payment failure notifications
- Allows payment retry during the grace period
- Continues processing even if notification delivery fails
##### `customer.subscription.deleted`
 
- Marks subscription as **Cancelled**
- Records cancellation events
- Prevents cancelled subscriptions from being reactivated by subsequent `invoice.paid` events
### Grace Period Management
 
Implemented automatic grace period handling to improve user experience during failed subscription payments.
 
When a payment fails:
 
- Subscription enters a **7-day grace period**
- Agency retains access to premium features
- Payment retries are supported during the grace period
- Successful payment automatically restores Active status and clears the grace period
- If payment is not completed before the grace period expires, the subscription is automatically cancelled
### Reliability & Fail-safe Behaviour
 
Payment processing is designed to remain resilient when supporting services fail.
 
The system continues processing payments even when:
 
- Email notification delivery fails
- SMS notification delivery fails
- Audit logging fails
- Redis experiences transient failures during non-critical operations
These failures are logged without interrupting successful payment processing.
 
### Automated Test Coverage
